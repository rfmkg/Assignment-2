# Assignment-2
Summary

This project uses a student mental health and academic pressure dataset in CSV format that contains survey responses related to students’ academic pressure, stress, and mental health conditions. The dataset is suitable for a machine learning task that focuses on analyzing patterns in student data and predicting mental health status.

Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem

Type of Problem:
This is a classification problem.

Target Variable:
Yes, the dataset includes a target variable related to students’ mental health status or stress level.

Model Objective:
The model is expected to learn patterns from academic pressure and mental health-related features and predict the mental health condition of students.

Problem Description:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that predicts students’ mental health status based on academic pressure and survey responses.
